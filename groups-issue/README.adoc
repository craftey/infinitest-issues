# Issue with infinitest and groups

I have 5 Tests. `GroupTest1` should fail because it contains:

[source,java]
assertThat(true).isFalse();

But when we run this with Intellij's plugin *Infinitest* it looks like all tests pass:

image::img/all_pass.png[,500]

Tested with legacy version 5.1.116 or latest 5.2.0.

It turned out that I misinterpreted "All Pass".
It actually means that infinitest looked into 5 Test classes
and did not run any test method at all due to the `infinitest.filters` configuration
but still counted the class as success (what else :/).
This was a bit confusing in a big project with hundreds of Test classes where I
at first thought all included tests were green.

I think I had this confusion also because excluding Tests via filename pattern
removes the test classes from the final test count and I got used to it.

So here I would suggest to improve the result display whats actually happening in case of
groups exclusions/inclusions.
